# Semantic Chat Search

Semantic Chat Search is an AI-powered tool that enables contextually aware search across your chat histories from multiple platforms like **Skype**, **WhatsApp**, **Telegram**, **Facebook Messenger**, **Instagram DMs**, **Discord**, and **Slack**. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, it leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide more accurate, meaning-based results by understanding the context behind your messages. This project builds a semantic search index from your chat archives, allowing you to retrieve relevant information quickly and efficiently.

The system works by extracting chat data from various platforms, converting the text into high-dimensional vectors using language models like BERT, and then using a RAG model to return semantically relevant messages. Itâ€™s scalable, cross-platform, and open-source, with the flexibility to add new platforms and improve the search functionality. Contributions are welcome, and detailed instructions for integration and usage can be found in the repository.
